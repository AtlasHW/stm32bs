## Templates

The default template is [stm32bs-template-default] in github.

[stm32bs-template-default]: https://github.com/AtlasHW/stm32bs-template-default 

## Quickstart

### Installation

```sh
cargo install cargo-stm32bs
```

If you haven't embedded target you rust tools, your need install them.
for "STM32F0", "STM32G0", "STM32L0", "STM32C0", "STM32U0", "STM32WL3", "STM32WB0"
family, you should install target "thumbv6m-none-eabi".
```sh
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
``` 

for "STM32F1", "STM32F2", "STM32L1" you should install target "thumbv7m-none-eabi".
```sh
rustup target add thumbv7m-none-eabi
``` 

for "STM32F3", "STM32F4", "STM32F7", "STM32G4", "STM32H7", "STM32L4", "STM32L4+",
"STM32WB", "STM32WL"  you should install target "thumbv7em-none-eabi".
```sh
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi
``` 

for "STM32L5", "STM32U5", "STM32H5", "STM32WBA", "STM32N6", "STM32U3" you should install 
target "thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf".
```sh
rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
``` 

We recommend debug tools [probe-rs] as debug and download tools, you can download binstall first

[probe-rs]: https://probe.rs/

```sh
cargo install binstall
``` 
and using binstall to install [probe-rs]
```sh
cargo binstall probe-rs-tools
``` 


### Usage

if you want to use default template, you can change directory to you 
workspace or a directory to store rust code
```sh
cd ./rust
cargo stm32bs
ðŸ¤· Project Name: blink
ðŸ¤· Chip Part Number (eg. stm32g071cbt6): stm32g071cbt6tr
âœ” ðŸ¤· Choose a project type Â· Demo
Create a STM32 Demo project...
